U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed\, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs\, namely boxes A\, A'\, B\, C\, C'\, and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A')\, and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B\, C\, C'\, and D)\, the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif\, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs\, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localization\, stability and hypermethylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA." [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Rfam/getacc?RF00012]

Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures\, with eight helical elements. These fold into the Alu and S domains\, separated by a long linker region. Eubacterial SRP is generally a simpler structure\, with the M domain of Ffh bound to a region of the 4.5S RNA that corresponds to helix 8 of the eukaryotic and archaeal SRP S domain. Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis)\, however\, have a larger SRP RNA that also has an Alu domain. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54/Ffh M domain mediates signal sequence recognition.

def: "5S ribosomal RNA (5S rRNA) is a component of the large ribosomal subunit in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes\, it is synthesised by RNA polymerase III (the other eukaryotic rRNAs are cleaved from a 45S precursor synthesised by RNA polymerase I). In Xenopus oocytes\, it has been shown that fingers 4-7 of the nine-zinc finger transcription factor TFIIIA can bind to the central region of 5S RNA. Thus\, in addition to positively regulating 5S rRNA transcription\, TFIIIA also stabilises 5S rRNA until it is required for transcription." [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Rfam/getacc?RF00001]
