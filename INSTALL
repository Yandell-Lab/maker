How to Install Standard Maker

Note:  When using Mac OS-X and doing this installation you want to be logged in as
root on the terminal.  If you don't know how to do this, google how to enable the
root account on a Mac.  Type su on the command line and then type the root
password to log in as root once root is enabled.


1.  You need to have perl 5.8.0 or higher installed.  You can verify this by
    typing perl -v on the command line in a terminal.


2.  Install Bioperl 1.5 or higher.  Download the Core Package from
    http://www.bioperl.org

  a.  Type perl -MCPAN -e shell into the command line to set up CPAN on your
      computer before installing bioperl (CPAN helps install perl dependencies
      needed to run bioperl).  For the most part just accept any default options
      by hitting enter during setup.
  b.  Type install Bundle::CPAN on the cpan command line.  Once again just press
      enter to accept default installation options.
  c.  Type install Module::Build on the cpan command line.  Once again just press
      enter to accept default installation options.
  d.  Type install Bundle::BioPerl on the cpan command line.  Once again press
      enter to accept default installation options.
  e.  Unpack the downloaded bioperl tar file to the directory of your choice.
      Then use the terminal to find the directory and type perl Build.PL in the
      command line, then type ./Build test, then if all tests pass type ./Build
      install.  This will install BioPerl where perl is installed.  Press enter to
      accept all defaults.  For Mac OS-X BioPerl will install to
      /Library/Perl/5.8.6/ using this method.
  f.  Alternatively you can use Subversion to keep an up to date copy of BioPerl.
      See http://www.bioperl.org.  You will have to set PERL5LIB="path_of bioperl"
      in your .bash_profile if you choose this method.  You must also still follow
      steps a-d.


3.  Install WuBlast 2.0 or higher.  Download from http://blast.wustl.edu

  a.  You must register at the site before you can download wublast.  Registration
      is found under liscencing.
  b.  Unpack the tar file into the directory of your choice (i.e. /usr/local).
  c.  Add the following in your .bash_profile (value depend on where you chose to
      install wublast):
		export WUBLASTFILTER="/usr/local/wublast/filter"
		export WUBLASTMAT="/usr/local/wublast/matrix"
  d.  Add the location where you installed WuBlast to your PATH variable in 
      .bash_profile (i.e. PATH="/usr/local/wublast:$PATH").


4.  Install SNAP.  Download from http://homepage.mac.com/iankorf/

  a.  Unpack the SNAP tar file into the directory of your choice (i.e. /usr/local)
  b.  Add the following to your .bash_profile file (value depends on where you
      choose to install snap):  export ZOE="/usr/local/snap/Zoe"
  c.  Navigate to the directory where snap was unpacked (i.e. /usr/local/snap) and
      type make
  d.  Add the location where you installed SNAP to your PATH variable in
      .bash_profile (i.e. PATH="/usr/local/snap:$PATH").


5.  Install RepeatMasker. Download from http://www.repeatmasker.org

  a.  The most current version of RepeatMasker requires a program called TRF. This
      can be downloaded from http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html
  b.  The TRF download will contain a single executable file.  You will need to
      rename the file from whatever it is to just 'trf' (all lower case).
  c.  Make TRF executable by typing chmod +x+u trf.  You can then move this file
      wherever you want.  I just put it in the /RepeatMasker directory.
  d.  Unpack RepeatMasker to the directory of your choice (i.e. /usr/local).
  e.  Now in the RepeatMasker directory type perl ./configure in the command line.
      You will be asked to identify the location of perl, wublast, and trf.  The
      script expects the paths to the folders containing the executables (because
      you are pointing to a folder the path must end in a '/' character or the
      configuration script throws a fit).
  f.  Add the location where you installed RepeatMasker to your PATH variable in
      .bash_profile (i.e. PATH="/usr/local/RepeatMasker:$PATH").
  g.  You must register at http://www.girinst.org and download the Repeat Database
      Repeat Masker edition for RepeatMasker to work.
  h.  Unpack the contents of the Repeat Database into the RepeatMasker/Libraries/
      directory.


6.  Install Exonerate 1.4 or higher.  Download from
    http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate

  a.  You will have to download the source code and complile it on your machine.
      You will also have to install Glib.  If your using Mac OS-X you can do this
      by typing fink install glib.
  b.  Change to the directory containing the Exonerate package to be compiled.
  c.  To install exonerate in the directory /usr/local/exonerate, type:
      ./configure -prefix=/usr/local/exonerate -> then type make -> then type make
      install
  d.  Add the location where you installed exonerate to your PATH variable in
      .bash_profile (i.e. PATH="/usr/local/exonerate/bin:$PATH").


7.  Install Augustus 2.0  Download from http://augustus.gobics.de

  a.  Change to the directory containing the Augustus package to be compiled.
  b.  Unpack Augustus to the directory of your choice (i.e. /usr/local).
  c.  Change to the src/ directory inside the extracted augustus folder.
  d.  Install and compile Augustus by typing: make -> tthen type chmod +x augustus
      etraining -> then type cp augustus etraining ../bin
  e.  Add the following to your .bash_profile file (value depends on where you
      install augutus):  export AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/augustus/config"
  f.  Add the location where you installed augustus to your PATH variable in
      .bash_profile (i.e. PATH="/usr/local/augustus/bin:$PATH").


8.  Install Maker.  Download form http://www.yandell-lab.org

  a.  Unpack the Maker tar file into the directory of your choice (i.e.
      /usr/local).
  b.  Now add the following to your .bash_profile if you haven't already:
	export WUBLASTFILTER="where_wublast_is/filter"
	export WUBLASTMAT="where_wublast_is/matrix"
	export ZOE="where_snap_is/Zoe"
	export AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH="where_augustus_is/config"
