Revision history for Perl extension Proc::ProcessTable.

0.01  Mon Jun  8 11:37:47 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.03  Sun Jul 26 09:07:50 1998
	- added argument to va_end to make linux-ppc work

0.04  Fri Aug 14 22:51:31 1998
        - preliminary pre-alpha solaris support

0.05  Wed Dec  9 18:47:39 1998
	- fixed minor compilation problems for solaris. Changed rss to
	bytes on linux for consistency with solaris; also added "time"
	and "ctime" fields to linux for consistency. Updated
	documentation in Process.pm. Folded in AIX port by David
	Paquet <david-paquet@usa.net>.

0.06  Wed Dec  9 23:42:05 1998
	- added HPUX port by Mike Romberg <romberg@fsl.noaa.gov>.

0.07  Wed Jan  6 14:57:04 1999
	- added FreeBSD port by Slaven Rezic <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de>.

0.08  Thu Feb  4 00:35:53 1999 
	- Fixed bug in solaris hints file that was looking for a
	version of solaris returned by "uname -r" as > 2.5, when
	"uname -r" returns the "SunOS" version of 5.5. Fixed bug in
	linux module in which only the first field of the command line
	was getting passed in cmndline attribute.

0.09   Fri Feb 19 23:23:53 1999 
	- Fixed bug in Linux.c, fopen() called without corresponding
	fclose. Added empty DESTROY subs to ProcessTable.pm and
	Process.pm to fix occasional problems with mod_perl. Changed
	all instances of sv_undef in ProcessTable.xs to PL_sv_undef to
	comply with new standard.

0.10	Sat Feb 20 11:29:35 1999
	- Added code to ProcessTable.xs to check perl patchlevel
	version and use either PL_sv_undef or sv_undef since lots of
	people are still using older versions of perl.

0.11	Sat Mar  6 19:04:39 1999
	- Fixed code that checked perl patchlevel version to check
	directly for definition of PL_sv_undef and define it as
	sv_undef if it's not there, since it's not clear what
	patchlevel we need to check for. Also fixed embarrassing and
	unnecessary call to close() a string in Solaris.c

0.12	Sun Mar 21 10:53:56 1999
	- Hopefully the final fix for the sv_undef buglet.

0.14	Fri May 14 06:30:15 1999 
	- Added port for IRIX from W. Phillip Moore <wpm@ms.com> in
	0.13, but forgot to add files to MANIFEST and edit Changes
	(Duh). W. Phillip Moore's port also included a minor patch for
	Solaris to get the page size from the system. 

0.15	Tue Jun  1 21:33:16 1999
	- Added patch from Peter ? <hooft@natlab.research.philips.com>
	for IRIX version differences. There seems to be a lot of IRIX
	out there.

0.16	Mon Aug  9 22:59:46 1999
	- Added nanosecond Solaris patch from Rolf Petter Halle
	<rph@nextel.no>. Added port for dec_osf from Bernhard
	Schmalhofer <Bernhard.Schmalhofer@fazi.de>, which included new 
	version of test code as well. Added bsdi port from Sean Eskins
	<sean@gilasoft.com>. 

0.17	Thu Aug 19 10:57:16 1999
	- Lost connection to ISP during upload to PAUSE, and PAUSE
	won't let me reload it so I have to increment the version
	number. Kind of annoying.

0.18	Thu Aug 19 10:57:16 1999
	- Fixed bug (at least for linux) in Makefile.PL that was
	causing ProcessTable.xs not to be converted to ProcessTable.c; 
	this was carelessly introduced by me with integration of the
	port to dec_osf. Added port for netbsd from Peter Reich
	<pr@alles.prima.de>.

0.19	Mon Aug 30 00:22:02 1999
	- Reinstated 'OBJECT' argument in WriteMakefile in Makefile.PL 
	since it was breaking the build on dec-osf, but this time with 
	explicit object files to look for which seems to work, at
	least under Linux. Why this should be necessary is
	unclear. Added "fname" field to HPUX (was "cmd") for
	consistency with other ports and for new test. Added very
	basic "README.hpux". Added check in ProcessTable.pm to prune
	search tree for unreadable directories when finding TTY list;
	this was causing spurious errors during build on dec_osf
	since some directories under /dev are readable only by root.

0.20	Wed Sep  8 22:27:28 1999
	- Added "fields" method to module to return list of fields
	supported for the current architecture. This is implemented in 
	a slightly kludgy way, since it needs to call the table method 
	if the table method hasn't been called before, since only the
	table method knows the names of the fields. Also changed the
	test code to dump all the fields/values available for the
	current process table, instead of just dumping pids and
	"fname" which isn't supported on all architectures (though it
	should be). Added "example.pl" file which contains the same
	code. 

0.21	Fri Sep 10 12:32:13 1999
	- Bug fix; new "fields" method was crapping out on everything
	except Linux-Intel.

0.22	Tue Oct  5 07:47:54 1999 
	- Bug fix for Solaris; nanosecond process times are only
	available on 2.6 (and above?); this was causing the module to
	dump core on earlier systems. Also, size and rss appear to be
	in kilobytes, not pages in 2.6 and above (they are in pages in 
	the struct prpsinfo in < 2.6, but also available directly as
	bytes). 

0.23	Mon Nov  1 08:32:54 1999
	- Added patch from Dave Alden <alden@math.ohio-state.edu> for
	solaris "nice" and "onproc" fields.

0.24	Thu Jan 20 08:00:30 2000
	- Added patches from Noel Paul <NoelP@mincom.com> for dec_osf
	pctcpu and pctmem, and for IRIX for pctmem.

0.25	Thu Feb  3 11:20:27 2000
	- Added patch from F. Buirey <f.buirey@saprr.fr> for AIX SMP.

0.26	Fri Feb 11 16:43:48 2000
	- Added Proc::Killall from Aaraon Sherman <ajs@ajs.com>.

0.27	Thu Jun 29 08:27:23 2000
	- Added patch for converting jiffies to microseconds in linux
	from Philip Gwyn <fil@pied.nu>. Added patch from Slaven Rezic
	<eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de> for FreeBSD and to make Storable
	optional. 

0.28	Mon Aug 14 16:31:43 MYT 2000
	- Patch from Slaven Rezic <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de> to make
       test script -w clean.

0.29    Tue Jan  9 07:36:13 EST 2001
       - Patch from Wolfgang Friebel <Wolfgang.Friebel@desy.de> for
       os/HPUX.c to make the time method return useful values. Patch
       from Adrian Phillips <tandem@dnmi.no> to fix AIX cmndline
       field. Patch from Tryggvi Farestveit <tryggvi@firmanet.is> to
       fix bug in cmndline under Linux. Killfam.pm module from
       Steve Lidie <sol0@Lehigh.EDU>.

0.30   Sun Mar  4 05:05:26 EST 2001
       - Patch from David Good <dgood@stratasource.com> for 32-bit
       HPUX 11.0 support via the 64-bit interface. Port to Unixware
       7.x from Martin Lucina <mato@catalyst.net.nz>. Upgraded status
       to beta :)

0.31	Fri Jun  1 08:27:03 EDT 2001
	- Removed bogus test code line from os/Linux.c that was
	opening "/tmp/tedddi".

0.32	Sun Aug 19 04:45:25 EDT 2001
	-SunOS port from Shawn Clifford <shawn.a.clifford@lmco.com>. 
	Patch from Thomas Linden <tom@daemon.de> for additional Linux
	fields. Patch for bsdi from Nicolas Belan <belan@matranet.com>
	to add cmndline. 

0.33	Wed Oct 10 15:50:17 EDT 2001
	-Fixed Solaris large file environment problem (by turning off
	large file environment CCFLAGS!). Patches from Chris Adams
	<cmadams@hiwaay.net> for TTYs with device number(s) zero and
	Digital Unix table() call to read processes. Added
	README.taint for workarounds for perl -T. Changed umask for
	644 permissions for /tmp/TTYDEVS.


0.34	Sun Feb 24 21:55:07 EST 2002
	-Corrected documentation type pointed out by Marcus Crafter
	<crafterm@osa.de>. Fix for JIFFIES_TO_MICROSECONDS potential 
	int overflow on linux from Stephen Pillinger
	<S.M.Pillinger@cs.bham.ac.uk>. Patch for File::Find routine 
	on AIX (broken POSIX?) from H.Merijn Brand
	<h.m.brand@hccnet.nl>. Big linux code cleanup patch from
	Anthony Higa <anthony@squareusa.com>; I *think* this also
	fixes the linux-ppc problem reported by Marcus Crafter.

	
0.35	Mon Jul  1 11:24:43 EDT 2002
	-Patch from Thomas Glanzmann <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>
	to fix starttime overflow bug on linux. This should also fix
	multiprocessor starttime bugs. He says there is another
	overflow after 25 days of uptime though :(
	Nearly identical patches from Doug Lewis
	<dlewis@exchange.webmd.net> and Jan L. Peterson
	<jlp@flipdog.com> to fix taint problem. Patch from Peter van
	Hooft <hooft@natlab.research.philips.com> to allow non-root
	users to list processes on IRIX.

0.36	Tue Nov  5 23:04:12 EST 2002
	-Patch for documentation typo for Killfam.pm from Mike Castle
	<dalgoda@ix.netcom.com>. Patch for AIX v4.2 from James
	FitzGibbon <james@ehlo.com> to take advantage of newer OS API;
	this also required addition of a new return type (long-long,
	specified as "j") to ProcessTable.xs. Patch to add new field
	"numthr" for number of threads for Solaris from Joseph
	Cavanaugh <Joseph.Cavanaugh@FMR.COM>. Patch for linux compiler
	warnings from Marcus Crafter <crafterm@osa.de>. Changed HPUX
	"cmd" field to "cmndline" for consistency with other ports at
	the suggestion of Craig Cook <cncook@gene.COM>. Windows port
	via Cygwin from J Robert Ray <jrray@jrray.org>. Patch for
	multithread support under Solaris from Kong Li
	<Kong.Li@netiq.com>. Patch for File::Find::prune tty mapping
	buglet from <jon@jjb.demon.co.uk>. Changed behavior of
	store_ttydev() in ProcessTable.xs to insert an empty string
	for processes that don't have a tty, instead of having it
	return undef. I *think* this will fix a problem reported on
	HPUX by H.Merijn Brand <h.m.brand@hccnet.nl>. Changed ttynums
	to be treated as unsigned to fix occasional negative ttynum
	bug reported by Daniel Berger <djberge@qwest.com>. 

0.37	Fri Nov  8 09:50:56 EST 2002
	-Patch from Philip Molter <philip@texas.net> to fix typo in
	Solaris.c. 

0.38	Fri Dec  6 22:23:20 EST 2002
	-Fixed my omission of new AIX files from MANIFEST. Patch from
	Tim Cutts <tjrc@sanger.ac.uk> for Tru64 clusters.

0.39	Fri Oct  3 11:45:21 MDT 2003
	-Project is now hosted on SourceForge. Patch from Aaron
	Sherman <ajs@ajs.com> from rt.cpan.org ticket #2578 to add a
	warn function ppt_warn() instead of sending errors to stderr;
	changed linux, bsdi and aix. Added ppt_croak and updated
	PORTING docs. Added port to Darwin from Tom Wyant
	<twyant3@comcast.net>. Added port to Nonstop-UX from Mike
	Steinert <mike.steinert@motorola.com>. Patch from
	James.FitzGibbon <James.FitzGibbon@target.com> for AIX 5.1
	command line args. Added note to README.dec_osf that root
	access is required.

0.40	Sun Jul 10 19:10:16 MDT 2005
	-Added patch for support of FreeBSD-5 via kvm from Oleg King
	<king2@kaluga.ru>. Added contrib directory and pswait script
	from dominix <dominix@despammed.com>. Patch from Steve Linn
	<steve@rhythm.com> to handle processes larger than 2GB. Added
	jiffies-to-microseconds patch for linux from Jason A. Smith
	<jason@jazbo.dyndns.org>. Added patch from rt.cpan.org ticket
	#12951 to fix Solaris 8 with multi-threaded Perl where 
	readdir_r is defined differently for POSIX compiles. Patch for
	misreport of PID in cygwin (rt.cpan.org ticket #12840).
	Fix for FC4 gcc-4 buffer overrun complaint. 

0.41	Fri Jun 30 22:04:43 MDT 2006
	-Port to openbsd from <bsd@openbsd.rutgers.edu>. Fix for
	EOVERFLOW in HPUX 11.11 from <alan.martin@oracle.com>
	(rt.cpan.org ticket #18932). Module now requires perl 5.6 as
	suggested by <rdusong@tique.org> (rt.cpan.org ticket
	#15279). Patches from <reini.urban@gmail.com> for killall to
	use fname if cmndline is not defined and rename PID_ZOMBIE to
	PID_ORPHANED under cygwin (rt.cpan.org ticket #14837,
	#14836). Fixed empty pctmem bug on linux due to change in
	format of /proc/meminfo (hopefully this format is stable
	now??).
