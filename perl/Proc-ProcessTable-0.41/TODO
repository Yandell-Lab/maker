- "pctcpu" means different things on different systems. On linux, it
means percent CPU used by a process since its start; on Solaris, it
means a recent average of percent CPU ala top (the kernel provides
this piece of info). Rumor has it that on some systems it means
percent CPU since boot. The use of the "pctcpu" field should be
deprecated and it should be replaced in each module by one of three
fields: pctcpu_r for recent usage, pctcpu_s for since process start,
and pctcpu_b for since boot. Then, where possible, the other fields
should be populated (we should look at how top does recent usage).

- Since a lot of systems seem to support microsecond resolution, all
times should probably be handled in microseconds. The problem of
course is that this number can get really big; presumably this is why
Solaris uses a structure to store it. I don't know what the best
solution is here; pass it in as a long and hope that's big enough, or
maybe as a string and let perl deal with it?

- There should be some sort of minimal useful set of attributes with
consistent units that all OS modules should support. Maybe this should
be part of a firmer spec than what's in the PORTING file.

- Consistent cross-platform performance on multi-cpu machines would be
really nice for things like pctmem and pctcpu, but this is where the
operating systems really diverge so getting consistent meaningful
information would be hard.
