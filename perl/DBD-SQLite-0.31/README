DBD::SQLite
===========

SQLite is a small fast embedded SQL database engine.

DBD::SQLite embeds that database engine into a DBD driver, so
if you want a relational database for your project, but don't
want to install a large RDBMS system like MySQL or PostgreSQL,
then DBD::SQLite may be just what you need.

It supports quite a lot of features, such as transactions (atomic
commit and rollback), indexes, DBA-free operation, a large subset
of SQL92 supported, and more.

Installation requires a compiler.

The engine is very fast, but for updates/inserts/dml it does
perform a global lock on the entire database. This, obviously,
might not be good for multiple user systems. So beware. The
database also appears to be significantly faster if your
transactions are coarse. One performance benchmark I did was
inserting 100_000 rows into the database - with AutoCommit
on it was doing about 50 rows per second. When I turned AutoCommit
off it went up to 1000 rows per second.
