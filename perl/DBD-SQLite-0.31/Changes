    - Automatic binary encoding added (via a flag)

    - Extension functions and aggregates can be created in
      perl space now.

0.25
    - Fixed Makefile.PL to no longer try creating a .c file to determine
      the OS ptrsize - use Config.pm directly in the DEFINE
    - Major updates from Tim Bunce to bring DBD::SQLite in line with
      the DBI spec and other drivers, including:
      - Support for table_info_all() and primary_key_info()
      - $sth->{NAME} updates
      - execute() returns number of rows updated
      - $dbh->{sqlite_version} returns the SQLite version in use
      - $dbh->{sqlite_encoding} returns the SQLite encoding in use
      - Improved trace debugging
      - Improved error handling
      (many MANY thanks to Tim for all these patches!)
